An effective and awesome youtube video thumbnail should perfectly suit your video and attract visitors to click on the video. Today, I am going to tell you how to make thumbnails for youtube videos online for free and quickly.

## How to make thumbnails online for free and quickly.

First of all, go to your youtube account and play the video you want to make a thumbnail for. Find a spot that fits perfectly for the video and take a screenshot of it and save it.

Now, go to canva.com and click on **Create a design** on the left side menu. From the top right corner, click on **Custom dimensions**. Here, set the width to 1280px and height to 760 px which is the recommended youtube dimensions.

&nbsp;

Now, upload the picture you just took by clicking the **Upload** option. You can customize this picture by using different tools from the left side panel.  You can change the background color, fonts, text etc. After you are done with customization, download the image.

&nbsp;

Now, go to **YouTube Studio (beta)** and click on **Videos** in the dashboard. Now, search that particular video and click it. You will see a custom thumbnail option below, click on it and select the customized image you just downloaded and click on **Open**. Now, press the **Save** button and the new thumbnail is set.
