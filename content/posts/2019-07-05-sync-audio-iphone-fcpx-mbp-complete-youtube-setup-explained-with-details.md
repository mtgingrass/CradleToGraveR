How to use your <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="iPhone 7" href="https://amzn.to/2JtFW7l" data-linkid="507" data-shortcode="true">iPhone</a> with your MacBook to record with a <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Green Screen Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JVzMgP" data-linkid="511" data-shortcode="true">green screen</a> and synchronize your audio on the timeline.

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That clap is so I can synchronize my audio between videos. What I have is a setup which I&#8217;m going to show you in a second of a <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="MacBook Pro Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JsJ4Ab" data-linkid="519" data-shortcode="true">Macbook Pro</a> an external microphone, the <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Blue Yeti" href="https://amzn.to/2IheZTG" data-linkid="497" data-shortcode="true">Blue Yeti</a>, and my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="iPhone 7" href="https://amzn.to/2JtFW7l" data-linkid="507" data-shortcode="true">iPhone 7</a> doing the actual recording of me. The talking head behind me is a <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Green Screen Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JVzMgP" data-linkid="511" data-shortcode="true">green screen</a> and some lights you probably can&#8217;t see them once I&#8217;d make this edit. What I&#8217;m going to do in this video is I&#8217;m going show you how my setup is actually laid out and how I synchronize the audio, how I make my talking heads and how I record everything and piece it all together. All in just a few minutes. So stay tuned.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Okay. So I want to show you my set up and how I do this. What I have here is my laptop that&#8217;s connected to my microphone and it&#8217;s connected to this other <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a>. So if I need to get some information that&#8217;s not being recording cause I&#8217;m recording just this display. Now what I have set up over here is my actual iPhone. My iPhone is actually going to do the video of just me and my computer is only going to do the video of what&#8217;s on the <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a>. First of all it saves my hardware from trying to double record things which might be a little bit more efficient. It does handle both, but I like the quality of my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="iPhone 7" href="https://amzn.to/2JtFW7l" data-linkid="507" data-shortcode="true">iPhone</a> better than the <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="MacBook Pro Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JsJ4Ab" data-linkid="519" data-shortcode="true">Mac book pro</a>. Um, Standard Web Webcam. I have <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Green Screen Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JVzMgP" data-linkid="511" data-shortcode="true">green screen</a> behind me and behind that are two lights and I have the lights behind my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Green Screen Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JVzMgP" data-linkid="511" data-shortcode="true">green screen</a> which give it some more flare.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It&#8217;s not on right now cause I don&#8217;t need it. However, what I wanted to demonstrate was how, how I set up my actual phone so that I can see if it&#8217;s in the right position cause I have to set it up and I can&#8217;t see the Ford facing forward facing <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a>. So I actually go to quick time. So what I do is I go to quick time player on my computer, I go to file, new movie recording and then there&#8217;s a little dropdown here you can pick between your, your phone and your facetime camera, which you can&#8217;t see. But now I can see myself from this, um, from my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="iPhone 7" href="https://amzn.to/2JtFW7l" data-linkid="507" data-shortcode="true">iPhone</a> so I can see that I&#8217;m in a good position for my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Green Screen Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JVzMgP" data-linkid="511" data-shortcode="true">green screen</a> to crop it. And then once I do that, I actually closed this out cause I&#8217;m not trying to record me with my computer. I&#8217;m trying to record me with just my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="iPhone 7" href="https://amzn.to/2JtFW7l" data-linkid="507" data-shortcode="true">iPhone</a>. So then I reached behind and I click the play button, the record button. In fact, you should probably do that while it&#8217;s open. So let&#8217;s go back over that to quick time. It should be recording right now on my phone. So if I go to file new movie recording, you can see that it&#8217;s recording because there&#8217;s no record button there anymore, but I&#8217;m not going to record on my actual laptop</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">and that&#8217;s it.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I made this clap so that we can synchronize the audio. Now you can see on my timelines, I put two timelines together. The bottom one and the top one. One of them is the obs, one of them is me with my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="iPhone 7" href="https://amzn.to/2JtFW7l" data-linkid="507" data-shortcode="true">iPhone</a>. What I&#8217;m showing you is these spikes right here is when I clapped and I actually have multiple spikes. Um, I know that this spike right here is my clap in the video and I know that the audio that I want to line up with that is right here. And you know that because they had the same signature. Let&#8217;s see if that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m going to, first of all, I&#8217;m going to blade part of the top, but hitting the B button and then going back to a button, press it and delete. Let&#8217;s move this clap. So it&#8217;s relatively close to the other one and we&#8217;re going to zoom in on it first.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Before we zoom in though, let&#8217;s go to this film strip here and make it so it shows just the audio only. So that&#8217;s this button here. Now you can see the claps. Actually, they&#8217;re almost lined up perfect now, but to get a better visual, let&#8217;s click near it. And hit command plus plus plus a few times until we get real close. And you can kind of Arrow over to the beginning of the clap. And the top one is the video. Remember in the bottom one is just my audio from obs and I am recording this right now with obs, which is right here doing the recording. I&#8217;m going to move that out of the way so we can record my final cut pro. So we want to line these up as best we can. As you can see they&#8217;re off by just a little bit. So if I move it over, you&#8217;ll notice that you can&#8217;t move it quite exact. But getting it this close is definitely good enough. And what I&#8217;m going do is I&#8217;m going to blade the bottom one to be about here. And when I delete the bottom one, it should, Yup. Excuse me. Uh, I&#8217;m going also play the top one. So let&#8217;s go ahead and delete that one. And this one.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And it looks like they&#8217;re lined up. Once they&#8217;re lined up, look at the signatures as we go. They are definitely looking very much the same except one&#8217;s got a higher amplitude than the others. So I know we&#8217;re sinked up pretty good. So at that point I&#8217;m going to go ahead and mute basically by dragging the decibel meter on the top one down to negative infinity. So that essentially gets rid of the audio on the top one. I&#8217;m going zoom back out a little bit and then I&#8217;m going to go back to my film strip and set it back to where I like it, where I could see both the audio and the video. I&#8217;m going to hit play real quick just to see how it works. It looks good to me. So that&#8217;s how you synchronize the audio.
