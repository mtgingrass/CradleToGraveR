## Convert File Extensions.

Sometimes, you find yourself converting one file extension to another for various reasons. Many software programs will not read files such as a **.xlsx**¬†or **.xlsm**¬†Excel file. They will, however, easily read a .**csv** file.

In this tutorial, I will show you how to use an already created macro to convert an entire directory of files to a new file extension almost instantly. It saves a tremendous amount of time using macros for this.

In this tutorial you will learn:

  * How to convert **XLSX** file extensions to **CSV**
  * How to convert any file extension to another
  * How to open a dialog box for user input (folder selection)

Watch the Video for a step by step guide on how to use this macro.
