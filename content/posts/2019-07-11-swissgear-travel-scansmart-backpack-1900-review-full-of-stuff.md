<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I puchased them off of Amazon for about $64 with shipping included (Prime member). As you see from the below photo, I show you what it&#8217;s like with it fully stuffed to the max! </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I purposely wanted a backpack<img id="amznPsBmPixel_8793172" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; height: 0px !important; width: 0px !important;" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?source=bk&t=swissgear-review-20&bm-id=default&l=ktl&linkId=48db546dfa8a0a16689a9a4edb8cb983&_cb=1562804535456" alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0" /> that could hold two laptops, so this is what I chose and I&#8217;m pretty happy with the results. It&#8217;s very heavy with my two laptops packed in; however, it fits on my back pretty snug and it&#8217;s actually very  comfortable. </span>
</p>

<img class="wp-image-528 aligncenter" src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.19.35-PM-281x300.png" alt="Swiss Gear Backpack on my back" width="265" height="283" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.19.35-PM-281x300.png 281w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.19.35-PM-768x819.png 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.19.35-PM-960x1024.png 960w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.19.35-PM.png 1026w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" />

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now I&#8217;m going to show you exactly what&#8217;s inside of this so you know what you could fit inside of yours if you choose <a class="thirstylink" title="Swissgear 1900" href="http://markgingrass.com/recommends/swissgear-1900/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy</a> it.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">It&#8217;s on the side here. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-534" src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.33.50-PM-212x300.png" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.33.50-PM-212x300.png 212w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.33.50-PM.png 586w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px" />I have one charger for my phone in there. A lot of people use it to hold a <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Tripod Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2Eo2wv4" data-linkid="512" data-shortcode="true">tripod</a> &#8211; just snap it in. The pockets are very deep, you can easily fit the cord inside the side pocket if you want to. All the zippers are very sturdy and it seems like they&#8217;re going to last. Right in the front you&#8217;ve got a couple of things that are going to allow attachments. You can attache things like a tent or something like that. The backpack has a couple of different pockets within the pocket and as you can see, if you want to get a little bit closer, this has a bunch of pens and pencils and markers down here. It holds pens on the side.</span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There&#8217;s a little pocket right here with a little mesh bag. Put things in a, I always carry extra contacts in here. Flashcards. It&#8217;s a little pocket there and then there&#8217;s a pocket behind here and I carry my tia 89 calculator in a couple of the peripherals. </span>
</p>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-536 alignright" src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.39.45-PM-300x236.png" alt="" width="300" height="236" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.39.45-PM-300x236.png 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.39.45-PM-768x603.png 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.39.45-PM-1024x804.png 1024w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.39.45-PM.png 1424w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><span class="s1">Inside there is also a little key holder. I use it to hold my laptop key. It locks my laptop when it&#8217;s when I&#8217;m at lunch, but you can easily pop this thing off and put it back on and it comes with the bag. It comes with a carabean.  </span>

<span class="s1">Then there&#8217;s a little pocket up here. I put my mice, my mouse, a couple of other USB cords in here for them, it&#8217;s pretty deep to get to all that stuff in there including my context solution and if you could kind of get a feel of how deep it is right there, stick it all back in there. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-537" src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.43.23-PM-300x235.png" alt="" width="300" height="235" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.43.23-PM-300x235.png 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.43.23-PM-768x601.png 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.43.23-PM.png 936w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Next, we have the compartment where I put my books. It&#8217;s got two zippers. You can zip it out like this and you can kind of just don&#8217;t hold it down like that and you can see these books are here big fat books. They fit. I, if you can get a picture of inside here, how big that is, that actual area. See the bottom, that&#8217;s a lot of room in there and that&#8217;s without my laptop in there yet. There&#8217;s another compartment for that. </span>
</p>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-538 aligncenter" src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.45.05-PM-294x300.png" alt="" width="294" height="300" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.45.05-PM-294x300.png 294w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.45.05-PM-768x783.png 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-10-at-9.45.05-PM.png 936w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" />

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">We have a Mesh zipper bag right here and I&#8217;m going to put a couple of things in there like my USB charger and my battery and SD cards have the little pouch here. It&#8217;s meant for like an iPod or a phone, but I just keep this camera lens that I have inside here for now. You can put whatever you want in there, but there&#8217;s a pocket there and there are dividers.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There&#8217;s one, two. Then there&#8217;s even a half divided down here. So this you get these for compartments really, and I just put my folders there for now. I haven&#8217;t used this bag that just for a couple of weeks now, but it holds my books, all my electronics. It holds everything I need. So I&#8217;m going to show you the compartment. Oh, let me show you the other side. Now I&#8217;ve got my other charges are from my other laptop pocket here. Again, just like the other side, there are side pockets. There&#8217;s nothing in there now, but they&#8217;re very deep so you can fit stuff in there. I&#8217;ve got my headphones in this little mesh more than, and again, <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Tripod Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2Eo2wv4" data-linkid="512" data-shortcode="true">tripod</a> or something can be on this side. It&#8217;s pretty good. Now going into the other side, we have straps. You can hook things up here. I&#8217;m not sure if you can hook up like a water bottle to some, some bags to hook a water bottle to in the inside, like those, you know, Mesh bags that have the straws that come out.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Anyways, here&#8217;s a quick access zipper for your laptop and it&#8217;s right here. Here&#8217;s my one laptop here. It&#8217;s got fairly good padding. I&#8217;m gonna shut that and show you the main access point for the laptop. And this one has two zippers as well, so you can unzip both sides and it actually pulls out like that. Now you can see I have this laptop here that&#8217;s been just sitting there and this laptop here, I have two laptops because one&#8217;s for working, one&#8217;s for my own personal use inside this compartment. It&#8217;s a mesh compartment. There&#8217;s a little strap you can strap down your laptop with. You can see it right here. It straps in and it&#8217;s got a Velcro to keep it nice and secure. And that strap for me, it actually gives a little pad in between the laptops so they don&#8217;t bump together. This laptop here.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I just laid flat here when I, when I secure it, but there&#8217;s also room for like an iPad or something else here that&#8217;s is the mesh here, so you can possibly fit in a third device in here fairly easily. Now it&#8217;s very heavy and I&#8217;ve been walking around and I&#8217;ve had no issues. Different fact, hey, due to my own stuff that&#8217;s in there, that being said, it&#8217;s got a very strong, sturdy plastic handle here. I mean, it&#8217;s not even bendable and you can carry your bag like that. And that&#8217;s my review of this <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Swissgear 1900" href="https://amzn.to/2XByRtO" data-linkid="510" data-shortcode="true">Swiss gear</a> travel gear, 1900 backpack. Thanks.</span>
