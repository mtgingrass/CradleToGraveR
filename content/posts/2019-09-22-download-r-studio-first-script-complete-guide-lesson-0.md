## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Download_R"></span>How to Download R<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

Your first task is to head to Google and search **download R**. The top link should be **R: The R Project for Statistical Computing** at **<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="www.r-project.org (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">www.r-project.org</a>**<figure class="wp-block-image">

You may get sub-links that direct you right to the appropriate download page for your operating system (Windows or Mac).<figure class="wp-block-image">

Once you&#8217;re on the download page, select the latest version to download and then save the file to your computer. Once the executable file has downloaded, run it and go through the installation popup windows until it&#8217;s finished. 

A note here &#8211; I didn&#8217;t see any bloatware or spyware when I installed so you should be good, but it&#8217;s always good to keep an eye open and not just mindlessly click through the installation process.

Now put **R** aside for a moment while we download **RStudio**. Return to Google and type (you guessed it) **download Rstudio**. The top result should be from **<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="www.rstudio.com (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank">www.rstudio.com</a>**<figure class="wp-block-image">

Click on the DOWNLOAD button for the free version **RStudio Desktop** and the page will shift down to show you a list of installers (if it doesn&#8217;t, just scroll down to the bottom of the page manually). Select the correct one for your OS to begin the download. 

Once downloaded, run through the installer popup windows just like before.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Find_R_and_RStudio_on_Your_Computer"></span>How to Find R and RStudio on Your Computer<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

**R** and **RStudio** may not show up in your list of programs or in your Start Menu so we&#8217;re going to have to go on a quick hunt to find them (nobody said programming would be easy).

On Windows, you&#8217;ll want to look in the normal program installation drive (normally **C**) then in **Program Files** (not Program Files X86). Inside here you&#8217;ll find the folders for **R** and **RStudio**.

At this point, we won&#8217;t need to go into the folder for **R** as we&#8217;re not going to use it as a stand-alone program. Instead, head to the **RStudio** folder, then into the **bin** folder. Once you&#8217;ve located the **rStudio.exe** file you need to make a link to it somewhere more useful. You could drag it over to your Task Bar so that there&#8217;s a shortcut there, or you could **Right-Click** > **Create Shortcut** and then drag the newly made shortcut onto your desktop. Whichever you prefer. 

To clarify where you should be looking one more time, the file path to find **rStudio.exe** will be:

  * Either &#8211; C:\Program Files\RStudio\bin
  * Or &#8211; **YourProgramInstallationDrive**\Program Files\RStudio\bin

Open **RStudio** and you&#8217;re presented with a layout like in the picture above. The left-side is taken up by the **Console** window. In the upper-right is the **Global Environment** and the lower-right is an area with various tabs including **Files**, **Plots**, **Packages**, **Help**, and **Viewer**.

The Console window is a direct input area where you can write and run code. As an example you could enter a simple sum like **2+2**, hit **enter** and it will calculate the results for you &#8211; give it a try. You&#8217;ll get the result **[1] 4**, where **4** is the result of your calculation.

Let&#8217;s try it using a variable. Type **a = 2+2** and hit enter. <figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-04c-1024x574.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1078" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-04c-1024x574.jpg 1024w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-04c-300x168.jpg 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-04c-768x431.jpg 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-04c.jpg 1519w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Assigning a variable a value in the Global Environment</figcaption></figure> 

This time you won&#8217;t see the solution displayed. Instead, a variable called **a** will be displayed in the Global Environment window (upper-right), along with its value, **4**.

If you type **a** into the console now, by itself, and press enter, you&#8217;ll get the same result as we did originally: **[1] 4**. The console has recalled the value we assigned and stored in the Global Environment to **a** and printed it as the result.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="How_to_Make_Your_First_R_Script"></span>How to Make Your First R Script<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

We don&#8217;t want to work directly in the console window most of the time. Instead, we want to create a new R Script and work there. To do this go to **File** > **New File** > **R Script** (shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+N**) and the program will open up another window which looks like a simple notepad.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-08b-1024x724.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1085" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-08b-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-08b-300x212.jpg 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-08b-768x543.jpg 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-08b.jpg 1324w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption> The new R Script window at the top and the Console showing at the bottom </figcaption></figure> 

The Console will automatically move to the bottom and the new window appears up top. The new window is used as a notepad to store code, and _it won&#8217;t run that code unless you specifically tell it to._ 

The first thing we can do is enter a comment, as shown in the screenshot above. Any line that begins with a hash symbol # will not be counted as code, so you can write whatever you like as reminders and comments for yourself or other people working on your project. 

To illustrate the point that this window won&#8217;t run code unless you tell it to, go to the next line and type **2+2** and hit enter. Nothing happened, right? Whereas if we did this in the console it would have printed the results. The way to get the code to run in our R Script window is to use **Ctrl+Enter** (Windows) or **Cmd+Enter** (Mac). Now you&#8217;ll see both the formula and the result shown in the Console Window underneath.

Let&#8217;s try **8+a** (remember we have a variable stored in Global Environment named &#8216;**a**&#8216;). Type that into the Script area and use **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter** to run it. Again the results will print in the Console.<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-1024x792.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1084" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-1024x792.jpg 1024w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-300x232.jpg 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-768x594.jpg 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1-Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube.jpg 1343w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Using a value from a variable stored in the Global Environment</figcaption></figure> 

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Play_With_Variables"></span>Play With Variables<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

The next step is to assign the result of **8+a** to its own variable, which we&#8217;ll call &#8216;**b**&#8216;. To do this, in the Script window type **b = 8+a** and then run this line of code (remember to use **Ctrl/Cmd** with Enter). The new variable **b** will appear in the Global Environment in the upper-right and should equal 12 (8+a, or 8+4).

Now we can try a few things with this new variable, **b**. Firstly, we can simply print it by typing **b** on a new line in the Script area and then running that line. The Console will print the result &#8216;**12**&#8216;. We can do this over and over and it will always print the same result. Unless that is, we do something that changes the value of **b** and put that later on in the code (so that it runs most recently).

For example, let&#8217;s go to the next empty line in the Script window and type **b <- 0** to declare b as less than zero. Now, when you run this line, the value of **b** in the Global environment will change to 0. 

If we want to we can change this back to 12 by running only part of the code:<figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-1024x463.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1087" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-1024x463.jpg 1024w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-300x136.jpg 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube-768x347.jpg 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Download-R-R-Studio-First-R-Script-Complete-Guide-Lesson-0-YouTube.jpg 1044w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Highlight and run only part of the code.</figcaption></figure> 

The way to do this is to just highlight the code you want to run and hit the **Run** button. This will put the value of **b** back to 12 in the Global Environment. 

If we run the _whole_ _thing_ then once again b will set to 0. This is because when the code changes a variable multiple times, the part that runs last will determine the final result.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Remove_All_Variables_from_the_Global_Environment"></span>Remove All Variables from the Global Environment<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

To remove all the variables that we&#8217;ve declared and are stored in the Global Environment, use this command in the Console:

**rm(list = ls())**

Hit Enter to run it, and then check the Global Environment to make sure everything is cleared.

For now, searching on Google will be your major source of help when you&#8217;re stuck. However, there&#8217;s a great help feature built into RStudio. You can access it by typing **?rm** into the Console, in this case, to show the help files for this command. These will show in the lower-right window like the screenshot above.

## <span class="ez-toc-section" id="Import_CSV_Files_into_RStudio"></span>Import CSV Files into RStudio<span class="ez-toc-section-end"></span>

If you have an Excel file that you want to use in RStudio, the best way to import it can be to convert it into a CSV file. RStudio works very well with CSV files.

In order to import it, we first need the full file location all the way from the root drive. If you don&#8217;t already know the file location then use your file explorer to locate the file, and copy the location from there. In my example shown below, it&#8217;s **C:\Users\canton\Desktop**.<figure class="wp-block-image">

Next, go to the Script window and delete the code that we had there before, we don&#8217;t need it. 

On a fresh line type **read.csv** and then pause everything. After a second or two of you doing nothing, RStudio will show some popup boxes. The yellow box helps you understand what kind of parameters go inside the function you&#8217;re trying to use. The first parameter is **file** and that&#8217;s simply the file that we&#8217;re importing into RStudio. The rest of the parameters such as **header = TRUE** and so on are all optional and I&#8217;ll cover more of those in later tutorials.<figure class="wp-block-image">

Go ahead and enter the file from earlier path into the code. Your full line should look like this:

**read.csv(“C:\Users\canton\Desktop\test.csv”)**

There&#8217;s just one problem. When you run this code you&#8217;ll get an error in the Console telling us we shouldn&#8217;t be using the **backslash \** in our code. <figure class="wp-block-image">

<img src="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-path-2-1024x1018.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1093" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-path-2-1024x1018.jpg 1024w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-path-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-path-2-300x298.jpg 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-path-2-768x764.jpg 768w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-path-2.jpg 1047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Change backslashes to forward slashes to avoid errors</figcaption></figure> 

RStudio uses the backslash \ as a special character in specific use cases, so it gets confused when you try to use a backslash in a file path. This is easily solved by using a forward slash instead. Once you&#8217;ve changed every backslash to a forward slash we can go ahead and&#8230;

  <div class="wp-block-column">
    <p>
      <br />If you&#8217;ve done everything correctly at this point, when you run the code, you should get results like this in the Console.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="wp-block-column">
    <figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/data.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1094" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/data.jpg 597w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/data-300x75.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></figure>
  </div>
</div>

The next thing we&#8217;re going to do is store the data from the CSV as a variable. In the Script window type:

**my_data =** **read.csv(“C:/Users/canton/Desktop/test.csv”)** 

The Global Environment will now show **my_data = &#8216;2 obs. of 3 variables&#8217;**. The 3 variables in this example are **Name**, **State**, and **City**. 

There are now a number of things you can do with this. For example, you could type **names (my_data)** into the Script window and the Console will print out the header names for us (again they are Name, State, City).

If I want to select just one of the header names I can do so by typing **names (my_data)[3]** which will print the 3rd header (City) to the Console. 

If you wanted to you could then identify this as a variable using **city\_header = names (my\_data)[3]** and it would show in the Global Environment.

These are all just examples, feel free to experiment by yourself and let me know in the comments what you managed to do.
