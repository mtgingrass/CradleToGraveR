In this interview, Mark Gingrass and Daniel Vargas (Dr. Vanhatten) talk about the struggles with creating a [YouTube][1] channel that pays while maintaining a full-time job. Stay tuned in every Sunday for more Q&A with Mark and Daniel.
  
[Dr. Vanhattan][2]

* * *

**Mark:** I&#8217;m mark Gingrass and this is Daniel Vargas. We&#8217;ll start with that. And I&#8217;m in DC and you&#8217;re in Chicago. I don&#8217;t know if you want to put that on there, but.

**Daniel**: Yeah, for sure.

**Mark**: Just, the fact that we&#8217;re far away.

**Daniel**: Yeah, I have it in my video introduction for the channel.

**Daniel**: Why, why do you, did you want to start a channel at this point?

**Mark**: So for me, you know, I&#8217;ve had the skateboard thing going for a long time and I put, I put in like, you know, probably 150 skateboard videos on there. And then I started putting these crappy videos and one day I had over a thousand subscribers or actually, I was before the rule so I can monetize pretty quick and I made like 8 cents. And so eventually I started making like 20, 30 bucks a month. And eventually, uh, just past couple of months I decided, hey, if I&#8217;m making 30, 40 bucks a month without even trying at all, like zero, didn&#8217;t even try. Um, what if I actually put in some effort, can I make three or 400 bucks a month? So that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at now. I want to jump from 30 to 40 bucks a month to 300 to 400 bucks a month.

**Daniel**: What was, so that&#8217;s really so like, uh, the thing that got you to monetizing and partner, whatever was the skateboarding?

**Mark**: Mostly because most of my videos were now I didn&#8217;t really monetize my skateboard videos so much, but, um, I put on like reviews and those were making the money. Um, the last, I mean I monetized the first few skateboard videos, but then I decided like, Hey, no, this is like a skateboard thing. I&#8217;m not going to monetize my hobby. Um, but now that my hobbies kind of switched a little bit too, hey, I am trying to create money on [YouTube][1] and, and whatnot. Uh, I literally just past two months, I monetize all of my skateboard videos. You know what I mean? It&#8217;s like you don&#8217;t want to monetize something that was like your passion. Like, Hey, this should be free. Everyone should be able to watch my skateboard video and enjoy the skating, not know that they&#8217;re trying to make me 10 cents off watching my video.

**Daniel**: Yeah. I mean, I get, dude, now I don&#8217;t care though. Like screw it.

**Mark**: Like I want all the money I can get.

**Daniel**: Yeah, no, I, I agree. Like, like the only reason I was thinking is that, um, I gonna read like, uh, this, we&#8217;ll go, we&#8217;ll edit this. Uh, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll go into our channel. There&#8217;s plenty of people that just have these types of conversations, but that is, I think there&#8217;s so much of it, uh, online already. But with skateboarding, uh, I mean, same thing that there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a ton, but it&#8217;s just a very intro. Even I like, I&#8217;m not a a skateboarding efficient or whatever, but I, I&#8217;ve gone into that rabbit hole of like basketball, a skateboarding, you know, like, well, I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say is that you run in, you were uploading first these thing that is very popular and probably what we&#8217;re going to be uploading or like how to code or what, like whatever you&#8217;ll be uploading. It&#8217;s not exactly something that everyone falls into that rabbit hole, you know, but uh, that a lot of people fall into the skateboarding.

**Mark**: Yeah. Yeah. So I mean I try to keep my channel as now and I know we&#8217;re not going to talk about like content so much, but like I try to keep my channel as like, Hey, this is me teaching you how to do something. Um, it can be programming or business, but the flip side is I also want to teach you how I create that content. So like not only am I gonna, not only am I going to teach you how to do like R programming, I&#8217;m going to show you how I recorded this, what software I used, how am I set up is, and how I market this stuff. So it&#8217;s like, you know, kind of like three things I do is &#8220;teach,&#8221; &#8220;technology&#8221; and &#8220;content creation.&#8221; And so I saw your introductory video yesterday. You sent me the uh, the unofficial, the unofficial internal only video.

**Daniel**: Yeah. I have to redo it. Like you said, like it&#8217;s one of those things that I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to have to read it like 10 times and I&#8217;m still, am I going to be happy? But yeah,

Mark: I don&#8217;t think you need to Redo it. You just need to put it on there. What are those? What does Mark Twain say? A in order to, uh, in order to get somewhere you have to get started or something like that.

**Daniel**: Anyways, that&#8217;s a fair point man.

**Mark**: And you&#8217;re going to, you&#8217;re going to hate every single first video you make no matter what. So you might as well just throw it on there.

**Daniel**: Yeah, that&#8217;s all. Hate it. That&#8217;s about it. Point.

**Mark**: You&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s perfect today. You might spend four hours on it today and get it perfect. Four weeks from now you&#8217;re gonna be like, damn, that was so crappy. It doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s going to be that way.

**Daniel**: That&#8217;s fair man.

**Mark**: So I want to start, um, I want to start another [YouTube][1] channel from scratch and my idea, you know, I like your idea of the 30 thing. I think that&#8217;s easy to talk cause we are in our thirties. Um, I&#8217;d like to pretend I&#8217;m in the young thirties, but I&#8217;m actually in the upper thirties, which sucks.

**Daniel**: Your what, 37?

**Mark**: Yeah. Okay. What are you 32, 33?

**Daniel**: I&#8217;m turning 31 next week, man.

**Mark**: Oh yeah, I&#8217;ll be, I&#8217;ll be on the forties channel and you&#8217;ll be still on the 30th channel.

**Daniel**: Yeah. But yeah, man, um, I&#8217;ve been trying to start this until I was 27. You know, like every year I&#8217;m like busier. I&#8217;m going to start my channel these year, you know. Um, I&#8217;m tired of procrastinating it. What is in his playstation four?

**Mark**: PS4. He&#8217;s got the PS four pro with the, um, the, the virtual reality thing.

**Daniel**: Oh, that&#8217;s sweet man.

**Mark**: Have you ever tried that?

**Daniel**: So I haven&#8217;t tried the PlayStation one, but I have the Oculus, which is the Facebook one. And uh, I don&#8217;t have the, like the oculus rift, which you need, like this monster, monster computer. But I have the, um, what is it called? It&#8217;s like the, the one that is portable and I mean, it&#8217;s really incredible. Man, I&#8217;ll, that&#8217;s the future man. That&#8217;s going to be exciting times ahead.

**Mark**: I know. And I haven&#8217;t played a video game in like 15, 20 years almost. And I played that and I&#8217;m like, I think I&#8217;m hooked. I was playing that Astro Bot game and I put that thing on there and it feels like you&#8217;re in the game.

**Daniel**: Yup.

**Mark**: I read a review on Reddit and the Reddit said, uh, the Reddit said once you play three d games or virtual reality games, you&#8217;ll never go back to regular two dimensional games ever again.

**Daniel**: Yeah. And I believe it, I&#8217;m in, they&#8217;re completely different, but there&#8217;s a certain truth to it for sure. Uh, I mean it&#8217;s mind boggling and ended up the PlayStation one is not even, uh, like, I mean, if you get the, the Microsoft one, I don&#8217;t remember what it&#8217;s called or they all call those Rafe, like the expensive one you&#8217;re supposed to install like a motion sensors in your living room and a, this cameras and I, it&#8217;s supposed to be incredible man. So, so, and that&#8217;s part of what I would like to also add in my channel, honestly. Like I think that would be a, uh, I would wait to do something that I love and then, you know, comment on Ada and uploaded and whatever. Like, you know who a PewDiePie was, right?

**Mark**: No.

**Daniel**: I wish I remember that specific studies like, but is this guy from Switzerland and he was making millions of dollars a year and all he did was upload videos of him playing video games and he would just come and he would, he would have like a little chromakey image of himself at the bottom and just just come. And he&#8217;s like, I think he wasn&#8217;t number one [YouTube][1] or in the world.

**Mark**: Oh my s my son would probably know who it is.

Daniel: I&#8217;m sure he might have heard of it. He wasn&#8217;t into shooter game, so if he wasn&#8217;t into into that, maybe he does, but, but yeah. Anyways, so, um, yeah, that&#8217;s part of a,

**Mark**: The problem with that is it&#8217;s so saturated. There&#8217;s so many people recording their games and there&#8217;s so many people doing commentary. So the question is how do you become, how do you make something even better than what&#8217;s out there? You know what I mean? Like you&#8217;ve got to have those ideas. Maybe you do.

**Daniel**: Man, there&#8217;s a lot of weight. Like I think some of it is luck, right? But at the end of the day, I also wonder how about your tags? Like the tags have to influence a lot, right? Like, like people looking for specific keywords. And uh, for that many times when I&#8217;m uploading the video and I&#8217;m done with it, uh, I just, uh, I don&#8217;t even know what, what tags I should use. And so then I end up adding like four and then probably my video never, uh, pops up.

**Mark**: That&#8217;s where [TubeBuddy][3] comes in. You need to get some, uh, some tools. So two buddies, what I use, what I did was I did a review of [TubeBuddy][3] and they, uh, they found me and they said, hey, you did this review, here&#8217;s a year for free. They hooked me up. And so once they hooked me up, I was hooked. Because when you type in like two or three tags, it looks at your description, it looks at the tags you put in there and it looks at your title, and then it looks at it scours the [YouTube][1] and it looks at other people with the similar titles and things, and it takes their tags and it recommends them to you. So literally you just click on it, click, click, click, click, click, click. Now you have 15 tags, click, click, click, click. Now you have 30 tags.

<figure style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">[<img class="size-medium" src="https://www.tubebuddy.com/assets/images/AffiliateAssets/logo-small-dark-background.png" alt="TubeBuddy" width="500" height="84" />][3]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">TubeBuddy</figcaption></figure>

**Mark**: It&#8217;s so much easier than trying to come up with tags on your own. You can literally go to a <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="SiteUnderground Link" href="http://markgingrass.com/recommends/siteunderground-link/" data-shortcode="true">site</a> that&#8217;s similar to yours. Look at their tags. And with two buddy, you can, you can click on copy and you can either make it a template for yourself or you can just paste them in as tags. Literally like two seconds,

**Daniel**: Dude.

**Mark**: And I don&#8217;t mean to plug [TubeBuddy][3] like completely throughout this video, but it&#8217;s such an awesome tool that, I mean, I, I will not NOT use it ever again. Like I&#8217;m going to use it every day.

**Daniel**: I thought I had a, it&#8217;s that chrome extension, right?

**Mark**: Yeah. Yeah. You can download it. The links going to be in our descriptions.

**Daniel**: Yeah, for sure.

**Mark**: Practice.

Daniel: You know, like I, I know that, uh, some other people do this sketchy stuff, but, um, so you know, like you&#8217;ll have to be careful of not uploading a copyright infringement material or whatever. Uh, but, but there&#8217;s these anime I watch, right? And it&#8217;s called one punch man. So it comes out every Tuesday. And I a certain, like this guy has, I don&#8217;t remember how many subscribers he&#8217;s got, but he&#8217;s got thousands and thousands and thousands. So what he does is that he will upload the whole video for 24 hours only. So people watch the video before [YouTube][1]. Flags it as copyright, they subscribe and then he removes it. And then, you know, like people get notified of the other video and watch the other videos that he can, you know, live there. But people aren&#8217;t really subscribing because he&#8217;s uploaded much. So again, everyone has their own method and there&#8217;s all these little like hacks and whatever, but it&#8217;s just that, you know,

**Mark**: It&#8217;s that gray line right there for sure.

**Daniel**: Yeah. Yeah. So, um, well what about your videos, the ones that you have uploaded lately? Like, I mean, are you getting more views every day?

**Mark**: Not Really? No, I&#8217;m not getting that many views. I think I am, it&#8217;s really hard to tell because I just started doing more consistent videos. Like, I put up some of the R programming and I&#8217;ll get like a, a couple of views and then a comment. And I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like legit or real, but I think I need to just stay on target. And even though I&#8217;m not getting a lot of views yet, once I have like 15 or 20 videos in a row, people are gonna be like, yeah, just go to that channel to watch our videos or go to that channel to watch supply chain videos or whatever the channel is. Ahh know, honestly, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m bummed out about my views, um, because some of the stuff I think is good, but I&#8217;m looking at my analytics and the stuff that makes money is like the review I did on a backpack or, uh, my first C++ program video I did freaking six or seven years ago, still gets lots of views. And I&#8217;m like, well, what about my new stuff? And it&#8217;s just not working yet, so I need to figure something out.

**Daniel**: So what are you, um, attributing that to like the fact that it&#8217;s in your all videos have just simply been there longer? So now since they started accumulating more views, maybe they&#8217;d come up faster in searches or that, or you think it was a content?

**Mark**: I think it&#8217;s, I know it&#8217;s both because the content, if you look at my first c plus plus video and you read all the comments going down, you&#8217;ll be amazed. You&#8217;ll think that I&#8217;m like the Mr. Brilliant instructor of the world, you know, based on the comments. And I&#8217;m like, wow. Like apparently I can teach very well. Like, I can teach people. Um, very directly and give them analogies. I can make them, I can be inside their head and know what they know and what they don&#8217;t know and teach accordingly. And I think people like that.

**Daniel**: Interesting.

**Mark**: I know the content is good on that c plus plus video.

**Daniel**: Do you enjoy doing it?

**Mark**: I enjoy it a lot more now. So like I&#8217;m looking forward to doing R programming because R is now, like everyone wants to get into big data and data science and all this stuff, but not everybody is a data scientist. They all want to be one but they&#8217;re not it. So how do you get started? What I think I&#8217;m good at, and this goes with like anything, it could be calculus, it could be program and it could be anything. I&#8217;m really good at introductory level teaching, but once it gets to the advanced stuff, yeah I&#8217;m good at it. But I don&#8217;t do it for a living, so I can&#8217;t teach it because I have to spend a lot more, it&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t, I have to spend so much more time researching and that part it takes so long. It kinda sucks. You know what I mean?

**Daniel**: So what about, yeah, I do know what you mean. Um, but what about for example, you said you wanted to open a new channel. Like would you separate that like, like the teaching 100% of them are Mark Gingrass and then a, anything has like this conversation on a different channel or are you going to keep it all in the same?

**Mark**: For now, this will be labeled for me under, uh, it&#8217;ll probably still be under &#8220;content creation&#8221; because we, even though we&#8217;re, we were talking about that right now. So creating content, how to get started. So my channel is, part of it is content creation. Although I&#8217;d like to focus once we get a first couple of videos down, like with, with our interview style here, we could probably focus on like, Hey, what am I, so like one of the channels I want to create is like &#8220;pet peeves&#8221;, but it&#8217;s going to be like all just me talking about pet peeves. I&#8217;d like to do like animations and like, you know, what drives you nuts? And I feel like, um, that would be a good channel. If you notice on [YouTube][1], which I know you noticed this stuff, some of the dumbest videos get the most viral views and they&#8217;re making boatloads of money. If I&#8217;m getting, if I got like 10,000 views and I made like $8 off of it or whatever, or six bucks or whatever, if they&#8217;re getting 10 million, are they making like 600 are they making, what are they making? You know, and it&#8217;s a dumb video.

**Daniel**: Yeah, no, absolutely. Uh, well there&#8217;s a couple, uh, things there, right? Like, like they might have a million views but might not be monetizing on it. Maybe they&#8217;re not making anything, but if they&#8217;re, if they are, uh, yeah, that would be a is $1 million question, right? Like, like how much money will I make? And the thing is the abuse don&#8217;t determine it is a, is a, the viewing time. So

**Mark**: The viewing time is what matters. Yeah.

**Daniel**: Yeah. So there&#8217;s no way of really knowing like every channel will be different. It could be two completely separate channels. I have the same amount of views and subscribers, but the other one could be killing it on the money part.

**Mark**: Yeah. Subscribe subscribers. I know that it&#8217;s meaningless. I know that it is really, but for me internally, it&#8217;s a quick way to gauge like, okay, if I&#8217;m getting more subscribers, that means people are definitely viewing my stuff. And if you&#8217;re going to look at views like, oh, I&#8217;ve got 166,700 views today, now I&#8217;ve got 168,244 views tomorrow that that&#8217;s hard to comprehend. But if I have 1,500 subscribers today and 1,600 subscribers tomorrow, I can be like, damn, I just grew by, you know, a hundred subscribers. It&#8217;s just more tangible to me even though it&#8217;s not, it doesn&#8217;t equate to money.

**Daniel**: No, for sure. In the Creator Academy, like they, they did explain the subscriber part, but uh, yeah, it is just a fact that if you&#8217;re subscribed to someone, like I&#8217;m subscribed to your channel, like, and I&#8217;m really just subscribed to like four channels really. Like I think it&#8217;s the last week tonight, uh, the Joe Rogan experience and the blog after college and a and yours and pretty much every time that you upload something, I get notified. So there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a higher chance that I will watch it.

**Mark**: How long ago did you subscribe to me? Do you know?

**Daniel**: Yeah, you asked me about it. Uh, like you&#8217;re subscribe to my channel and I did it. It was probably like a week.

Mark: Oh, okay. So it was really recently because I heard that when you subscribed, now you have to actively hit the little bell icon to get notifications.

**Daniel**: So it&#8217;s different. It&#8217;s so, so what I mean is you&#8217;re right and I should have explained better, but, uh, if you don&#8217;t hit the bell, you&#8217;ll still show up in my main <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a> when I log into [YouTube][1].

**Mark**: Okay.

Daniel: But if I hit the bell, I get an actual, I don&#8217;t even have to be in [YouTube][1]. Like if I&#8217;m using chrome for example, like I just get a certificate, like if I got a new email and so I&#8217;ll just click on it and now you, it sends you to [YouTube][1]. So I mean it&#8217;s definitely a good idea. Like if you can get people to hit the bell, that&#8217;s going to increase your views and viewing time for sure. So yeah,

**Mark**: I asked this guy on a, I&#8217;m on a discord channel, you know, discord is, cause you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re a Gamer, right? I mean you, you on discord?

**Daniel**: No, I don&#8217;t know what it is.

**Mark**: Oh, a lot of gamers use it so that they can have their own private chat rooms and stuff. Um, and they do a lot of like live streaming through discord. I don&#8217;t know a whole lot about, but you can set up a private chat room where it&#8217;s invite only and it&#8217;s free. So there&#8217;s a [YouTube][1] creator out there called a [YouTube][1] Creators Hub and I, I&#8217;m a patreon of his, so I pay a dollar a month, which, you know, I might just do it for a couple of months, but I wanted to, uh, to let them know that I&#8217;m, I, I enjoy his podcast. I paid the dollar a month and I get access to his discord channel.

**Mark**: It&#8217;s okay. I mean there&#8217;s probably 400 people may be total in there. So there&#8217;s actively, you know, a few people every time you enter that chat room. But I asked him, I said, when did you make the decision to like go from full time work in nine to five, to full time [YouTube][1]? Like how can you do that? And I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;d do it if I can get like a quarter of my income, I think I can do it. Well, this guy, he responded back, he goes, &#8220;well, when I was making double the amount on [YouTube][1], that&#8217;s when I knew I can quit my full time job.&#8221; He was making double the amount was making on his full time job. I&#8217;m like, Damn. And then I checked out his channel. Damn, it&#8217;s good. I&#8217;m like, ah, it&#8217;s a really, like, I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t compete with that today. I need to learn more things. He does info-graphics. He is the &#8220;Info-graphics Show.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, I checked it out. I&#8217;m like, damn, he&#8217;s good man.

**Daniel**: That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s interesting. I mean, it definitely takes some, I mean, it takes some balls to take that, that step, you know, you have a good job. Yeah. Yeah. And that&#8217;s the truth of it. So it is not just the fact that you will be quitting it, but, uh, you&#8217;re living in Washington d C, which is expensive. Uh, and if you quit it might be hard to get it back. Right.

**Mark**: And I&#8217;ve got my son and I&#8217;ve got insurance and he needs insurance. And really, I mean, you have to pay for all that. And, uh, I just can&#8217;t quit. I need to be making tangible money. I think I will. Uh, it&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s good. Wait, well, I&#8217;m recording from, from this and you move the angle a little bit, but it&#8217;s still good.

**Daniel**: Yeah, it looks, it looks solid.

**Mark**: You can&#8217;t see it Daniel, you&#8217;re looking through my, uh, my computer.

**Daniel**: Okay. Okay.

**Mark**: Isn&#8217;t it confusing?

**Daniel**: It is man. Like it really, it really is

**Mark**: My latest video that I put out, I think I put it out yesterday. It&#8217;s about how I sync the audio and how my setup is, and then with all this crazy crap. Editing that video is complicated too because like I&#8217;m editing a video to show you how I edit videos, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m going to edit videos to show you how to edit videos while editing videos. Like, Oh man, it gets confusing.

**Daniel**: Uh, I was checking yesterday some tutorials on Adobe premier pro, which by the way, like it comes with very, it&#8217;s crazy how a software has changed through the years, but you don&#8217;t really even need to go through [YouTube][1]. I realized that after I was checking some tutorials and even that has its science, there&#8217;s some people that make it look very, very easy, um, they zoom in on the right, right spots and, and they go quick. So like you don&#8217;t lose attention. Um, so again, everything will be practice probably man. Like it&#8217;s just one of those things. But going back to the other topic. So you personally, when would you make that leap? Like, like quit your job, like when you have to be making close to the same amount of money, does it require a certain amount of savings that you would have? Like for you, what&#8217;s the, when would you be like, okay, I&#8217;m doing it?

**Mark**: Um, if I, I know I&#8217;m not gonna make as much money as I, my job is great. Right? So it was really difficult. I think it&#8217;s going to be a matter of who pisses me off most in my corporate job and when I get frustrated enough because let&#8217;s say that I can make&#8230; Yeah, I can move for a little bit. Right? So, I mean, I can move down south to live with my sister for cheap. So if I can make like $35,000 a year, maybe 30,000 a year on [YouTube][1],

**Daniel**: You would do it?

**Mark**: I can live, I can live off that for a couple of years. And if I was doing youtube full time, I would think that I can double that and triple that, you know?

**Daniel**: Yeah.

**Mark**: But I&#8217;m not even close to that, so

**Daniel**: No for sure. For sure. But, but the point is that you think you&#8217;re going to get that, that the plan is to get to that point while working. Right?

**Mark**: I think I needed to get to that point while working to prove that, hey, if my my two hours a day on [YouTube][1], if I made that into eight or 10 hours a day, I should be able to scale it up. And it&#8217;s not just [YouTube][1]. So I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m battling [YouTube][1], Amazon affiliate programs, other affiliate programs. I&#8217;m also, I think, I think the moneymaker is going to be teaching on like platforms like [Udemy][4] or [SkillShare][5] or Thinkific. These different platforms. I think will allow me to, uh, really get more income and monetize in different various ways. You can&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket

**Daniel**: for sure,

**Mark**: but what I, what I try to do is I try to make it subsets of a class and I put some of it on Youtube and then I add some of it to Skillshare and then as I accumulate like more and more classes on the same topic, I create one big class and I put that big class on Udemy, which is, which is what you expect a 40 hour class on SkillShare. You&#8217;re expecting like a 20 minute class.

**Daniel**: Yeah.

**Mark**: Youtube, you&#8217;re expecting like a six minute class. So if you can reuse the content and recycle it for all these different platforms, why not?

**Daniel**: Why not? Absolutely. Like that. The thing is, it seems to me like you have more, a more clear idea of what you want to do. I just don&#8217;t know if I want to be. There&#8217;s plenty that I could upload as far as teaching man. It&#8217;s just, I guess I&#8217;m not that passionate it, but yeah.

**Mark**: I know, that makes sense.

**Daniel**: You know, like I, I just, I just need to figure it out because if I do do teaching, like, which I already have some videos put up together for that. Like you said, like I could kill two birds with one stone and do a Udemy and do whatever, but uh, I just need to figure it out.

**Mark**: It all depends on what you&#8217;re teaching too. If you, I mean, if you hate your job and you&#8217;re trying to teach the things you do at your job, that&#8217;s still gonna suck. It&#8217;s still, sh*t you don&#8217;t want to, you don&#8217;t want to teach. Oh my son told me that if you swear more than like three times on a YouTube video, they can demonetize it. So I&#8217;m going to bleep those out. In fact, I&#8217;ll have a video about how to bleep those out.

**Daniel**: Man. Like you should really, I&#8217;m going to check that in the Creator Academy cause uh, I mean there&#8217;s plenty of channels that I follow that swear constantly and they don&#8217;t get demonetized.

**Mark**: Okay. Maybe not you monetize, but it limits your advertisers to be a different subset of who can do advertising on your channel, which is probably no big deal for most people.

**Daniel**: Yeah. And that&#8217;s part of like, like I&#8217;m being super picky, but I guess in my ideal world, like, like, uh, if what I see happening with this is that I can be myself, that I can be drinking or doing whatever and, and, and if not the, I swear a lot as it is, you know, but that if, yeah, an &#8220;f&#8221; bomb, you know, drops out that they don&#8217;t have to worry about it.

**Mark**: No, that makes sense. And I, and I think that&#8217;s the only way to make it. Like, you know, you&#8217;re going to continue doing this because it&#8217;s actually fun and it is fun.

Daniel: Yeah.

**Mark**: Uh, I don&#8217;t want to be somebody else. And I&#8217;ll tell you what, this is the first conversation that I&#8217;ve had with somebody on, on Youtube. It&#8217;s 10 times better than talking to yourself. Holy sh*t, you know what I mean? I hate talking to myself. I feel like an idiot.

**Daniel**: That&#8217;s another point that you brought up, but what I&#8217;m kind of in the same spot. I don&#8217;t really have anyone to talk to about this stuff

**Mark**: Today you don&#8217;t, but now that we have each other, we&#8217;re going to talk to each other. Now I feel more confident calling somebody else and saying, &#8220;Hey, can you do an interview with me?&#8221;

**Daniel**: For sure. For sure. I already feel more confident with that.

**Daniel**: Yup. No I agree. As far as the, and again we can edit this whole part out and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be plenty of editing we&#8217;ll have to do with this one, but that&#8217;s what I was telling you earlier. Like the thing about it is that you and I can talk and we can do, you know like like the recording and in our own cameras and do whatever, but what about when you were just calling someone else? They&#8217;re not going to set up everything that you and I do, you know? Right.

**Mark**: What I&#8217;ll do probably is just have to do audio or I will do it physically with them in the room. What I, what I can do is I can do it physically with them.

**Daniel**: Yeah. That phyically part,

**Mark**: as long as I, as long as I take this bad boy with me, I go, well, I didn&#8217;t even realize it was in my <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a>. I was gonna I was gonna screenshot that out. But I guess not [laughter]

**Daniel**: But it doesn&#8217;t affect them. Like I don&#8217;t even think your microphone looks bad when it&#8217;s on the frame. Like I said, a lot of, uh, every channel oil and blogger that I&#8217;ve seen has that, like you can see they have their headset and their, their microphone either like yours or they have a one coming from, from the top. Yeah.

**Mark**: So I like this. I mean, I&#8217;ve got this thing too, but I don&#8217;t really use it because it blocks more of me and I just didn&#8217;t want that.

**Daniel**: What is that for?

**Mark**: It&#8217;s to decrease the amount of, like if you put like a p word, like &#8220;pa pa pa&#8221; versus like pop, pop, pop, it kind of pops more without, it really gives that big spike in the audio. It&#8217;s cheap, but it&#8217;s supposed to be effective.

**Daniel**: Yeah, yeah. I mean you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re slowly building and we&#8217;re, we&#8217;ll both start slowly building the professional, you know, uh, set up and everything. I listen that your, your <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a> looks better, you know, no wrinkles, no nothing.

**Mark**: Oh yeah. I, so I had a 15 foot by nine foot <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a> <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="Screen" href="https://amzn.to/2LMDuep" data-linkid="814" data-shortcode="true">screen</a> that I, I always had it folded and stuff. And when it&#8217;s all folded, you can&#8217;t really stretch it out as good. Yeah. And um, I finally cut it down. Now this, but behind me I have a, it&#8217;s eight foot by five foot and it&#8217;s so much more manageable. And I do have a stand and I do have a stand. Do you have a stand? You don&#8217;t have a stand?

**Daniel**: I don&#8217;t, but uh, I&#8217;m going to get one. I&#8217;m just really excited. And then I just have like 20 more days before the new apartment and I&#8217;m going to have a whole area, like a studio just just for this stuff, you know, so. So it will be good. Yeah.

**Mark**: I almost got a, a apartment. It was actually cheaper than the apartment I have now, which was a two bedroom in DC. You know, uh, it was a two bedroom plus a small den in the den was like the size of a computer room. Oh Man. I wanted that so bad, but it didn&#8217;t have like a balcony at all. And the view was not like to the pool. It was like to the outside street and so I didn&#8217;t get it. But now I&#8217;m like, damn, that room would have been my room. Nothing but videography. Crap.

**Daniel**: Yeah man. Uh, I mean, are you pretty content with your, your, you live in a really nice apartment now, right?

**Mark**: It&#8217;s really nice. Yeah.

**Daniel**: Yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s got its pros and cons, man. I lived in one of those, I&#8217;m guessing like a similar one to yours and I kind of miss it. Okay.

**Mark:** In closing I think we, I think what we have to do is let people know we&#8217;re gonna let them know that every, what day is today, Saturday,

**Daniel**: that every Saturday there&#8217;ll be a, or every Sunday a video will be uploaded. Right.

**Mark**: Every Sunday, a video is going to be uploaded, talking about our progress, and hopefully there&#8217;ll be others that can join and they can send comments and give us their links, show us what they do and what their progress is like. Right. I mean,

**Daniel**: yeah,

**Mark**: it&#8217;d be only fair if, if they&#8217;re going to look at ours, maybe we can look at some of theirs. Maybe we can critique theirs. No, okay. Maybe this is going too far. [laughter] Now I&#8217;m starting to sound like a YouTuber

**Daniel**: Dude, but, but you said it. I agree with that. I&#8217;m actually going to ankle with what you just said as that closing clip.
