Everyone is talking about _Citizen Data Science._ Is this just Another buzzword or is this the real deal? Will I have to throw out this word next year? Or is it going to stick? It reminds me of a little like the _Engineering Management_ degree. No offense if you have that degree but don&#8217;t be walking around telling people you are an engineer because the word is in the title of your degree. Truth be told, a _Citizen Data Scientist_ is not a scientist.

The truth is, who cares? Don&#8217;t worry about buzzwords or fancy titles. It takes a team of people to do anything complex in today&#8217;s world of data. Unicorns are hard to come by, so practice one part of the whole and get good at that. One such part you should focus on, as an aspiring Data Engineer or Data Scientist, is the Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) of data. Learn the art of creating efficient, readable, and modular pipelines.

You can wrangle data. You can move data. You can clean the data. How? You create data pipelines. So what exactly is a data pipeline?

The goal is to have an efficient flow of data from one location to the other in today’s data-driven enterprise. Analysis cannot begin until the data becomes available to someone who understands it. There are so many things that can go wrong during the transfer from one data system to another: data can change through manual intervention or data sources may conflict, data can be ill-defined.

The data pipeline is the automation of taking data from many sources (**extracting**) and **transforming** them into usable data. Then the data can be **loaded** into models that can perform visualizations or even make decisions.

The Tidyverse is a tool to do Data Science. It is a collection of packages that will help with creating data pipelines and make life much easier!

This series of tutorials is going to start from the ground up. I am assuming just basic programming background if any. However, I will go at a fast pace and skip a lot of theory to just get straight to the point. If you are already familiar with R and R Studio, you can skip this lesson and proceed to the next one.
