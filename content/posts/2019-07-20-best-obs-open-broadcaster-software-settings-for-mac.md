## OBS Settings for Best Screencast:

Today, I am going to tell you how to set your Open Broadcaster Software(OBS) video display settings to be perfect for recording.

First, Click on **Settings**, which is at the bottom right corner.

&nbsp;

Select **Output** from the left side panel. Here, set **Output Mode** as simple. After that, set **Recording Quality** as Indistinguishable Quality, Large File Size. Select the **Recording Format** to MP4, as it is the best format. Also, if you have any graphics card, select the graphic card in the **Encoder** otherwise select Software (x264). The output settings are now set.

&nbsp;

Now, check the **display settings** of your device from **About this Mac** option, which you can get by clicking on the Apple icon at top left corner. Then, click on the **Displays** tab and note your display settings.

&nbsp;

Right then, coming back to **settings**, select **Video** from the left side panel. Set **Base (Canvas) Resolution** and **Output (Scaled) Resolution** same as your display settings, in this case as 2800*1800. Now, change the **Downscale Filter** to Lanczos (Sharpened scaling, 32 samples).

<img class="size-full wp-image-676 aligncenter" src="http://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OBS2.png" alt="" width="808" height="227" srcset="https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OBS2.png 808w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OBS2-300x84.png 300w, https://markgingrass.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OBS2-768x216.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" />

&nbsp;

That&#8217;s it. Now, you will see the sharpest images and videos.
