I solved the Apple <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="AirPods Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LKCKWg" data-linkid="517" data-shortcode="true">AirPods</a> + Chrome + YouTube pausing issue. Ever use your Bluetooth <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="AirPods Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LKCKWg" data-linkid="517" data-shortcode="true">AirPods</a> from Apple while playing YouTube in Chrome (or other browsers) and it keeps unpausing paused videos? This might be the fix you have been waiting for.
  
Here is that TubeBuddy link I referenced: âž”TubeBuddy: http://bit.ly/t_buddy

  <span class="s1">Hey, welcome back everybody. I have a computer insider tip for those Mac users and the air. What are they? Air Buds or <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="AirPods Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LKCKWg" data-linkid="517" data-shortcode="true">airpods</a>? Hmm. I can&#8217;t get all that stuff. Straight <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="AirPods Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2LKCKWg" data-linkid="517" data-shortcode="true">air pods</a>. When they are being used with your <a class="thirstylink" target="_blank" title="MacBook Pro Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/2JsJ4Ab" data-linkid="519" data-shortcode="true">Mac book pro</a> or any other Mac and you have chrome open with youtube specifically, you start playing youtube videos. It will, it will play fine. You love it and then all of a sudden you pause it because you&#8217;re going back to your final cut pro or you&#8217;re going back to your programming. You start doing what you just learned. Then all of a sudden your youtube video plays again and you go back and pause it. It plays again, pause. It plays again. You get so frustrated that you take these bad boys out and you say, screw it. I can&#8217;t even do youtube with these because I can&#8217;t pause it anyways.</span>

  <span class="s1">It&#8217;s not everybody that has this problem, but it&#8217;s definitely relevant, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m making this tutorial to fix this problem. You&#8217;ll be very surprised at how easy it is. All you have to do is go to a new tab, type in chrome, colon, forward. Slash. Forward. Slash. Flags. I&#8217;ll put the link down there and when you do that, hit enter. You&#8217;re going to see this experimental page for chrome. And Eh, there&#8217;s so many things in here I don&#8217;t know what to do with. Now for me, I&#8217;ve already disabled this hardware and media, key handling. It&#8217;s clicked. It&#8217;s disabled, but it&#8217;s actually going to be down here somewhere. So just type in hardware media and it&#8217;ll pop up. What you want to do is you want to make it disabled and when you do that, you&#8217;re gonna have to restart your chrome though. So completely restart it and come back. And low and behold, you can finally pause your youtube videos and multitask. Hope you enjoyed this quick tip. If you want a good tip about how to increase your youtube work potential, tried to buddy, which is linked below and subscribe and hit that little bell. I guess that&#8217;s what people do nowadays. So take it easy. Yeah, that was stupid.</span>

  <span class="s1">Hello GRANDPA. You just call yourself a great, where did you come over here and tell him to hit the bell for me? Why don&#8217;t you tell him to hit the bell into this camera and tell him, hey dude, I guess that&#8217;s what people fear down, so you&#8217;re just like acting like a grandpa. Holy Moly. That&#8217;s hit that bell if you like this.</span>
